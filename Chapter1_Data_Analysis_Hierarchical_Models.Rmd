# What is multilevel regression modeling?

Consider an educational study with data from students in many schools, predicting in each school the student's grades *y* on a standardized test given their scores on a pre-test *x* and other information.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{$y$: student's grades for each school.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{$x$: Student's score and other information.}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

A separate regression model can be fit within each school, and the parameters from these schools can themselves be modeled as depending on school characteristics such as *socioeconomic* status of the school's neighborhood, whether the school is private or public, and so on.

> "The **student-level** regression and the **school-level** regression are **two levels** of a **multilevel model.**

More generally, we consider a multilevel model to be a regression in which the parameters (regression coefficients) are given a probability model. This second-level model has parameters of its own called **hyperparameters** of the model -which are also estimated from data.

> "The two key parts if a multilevel model are **varying coefficients**, and a **model** for those varying coefficients."
>
> "The feature that distinguishes multilevel models from classical regression is in the modeling of the **varying coefficients**."

## Models for regression coefficients

To keep notation simple, we assume just **one student-level** predictor $x$ (for example, a pre-test score), and **one school level** predictor $u$ (for example, average partent's incomes).

### Varying-intercept model

This is a model in which the regressions have the **same slope** in each of the schools, and only the intercepts vary. We use the notation $i$ for individual students and $j[i]$ for the school $j$ containing student $i$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_{i} & = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{j[i]}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}, \: \: for \: students\: i= \: 1, \: \dots, \: n \\
\alpha_{j} & = a_{0} + b_{0}u_{j} + \nabla_{j1}, \: \: for \: students\: j= \: 1, \: \dots, \: J \\
\beta_{j} & = a_{1} + b_{1}u_{j} + \nabla_{j2}, \: \: for \: students\: j= \: 1, \: \dots, \: J
\end{split}
\end{equation}
